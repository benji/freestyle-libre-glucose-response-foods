Carbs are transformed into simple sugars in the blood stream which increases insulin.
Insulin signals the body to store excess sugar as fat.

"High glucose level after a meal promotes both hunger and weight gain."

- risk of over producing insulin and causing drop of glucose 
- sugar craving
- higher post meal glucose level predicts overall higher mortality
